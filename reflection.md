# Reflection

Setting up my Django project presented several challenges. First, installing Python and ensuring the virtual environment was active took some effort, as I had to make sure the correct paths and versions were used. Next, running the development server initially displayed a white screen because my templates and URLs were not properly configured. I solved this by creating views with `HttpResponse`, setting up URL patterns, and using template inheritance correctly. 

Another challenge involved Git. When I first tried to push my project, Git reported that my user name and email were not set, and later the remote repository was incorrect. I resolved this by configuring my global Git identity, removing the old remote, and adding the correct repository URL. 

Overall, these steps taught me the importance of careful environment setup, checking configuration files, and troubleshooting errors methodically. I also gained practical experience with Git and GitHub, ensuring my project files and screenshots were successfully pushed online.
